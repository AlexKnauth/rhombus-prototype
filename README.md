[Rhombus](https:://rhombus-lang.org) is a general-purpose programming
language that is easy to use and uniquely customizable.

For an overview of Rhombus's goals and design, see

* [Documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rhombus@rhombus/index.html)
  as rendered by the Racket package-build service

* [OOPSLA'23 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3622818)
  or the [talk video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkiy1rmKA48)

This repository houses the Racket packages that make up the current
Rhombus implementation.

# Trying Rhombus

The quickest route to trying Rhombus is the
[snapshot Racket with Rhombus included]("https://users.cs.utah.edu/plt/rhombus-snapshots/").

Alternatively, using [Racket](https://racket-lang.org), install the package `rhombus`
through DrRacket's "Install Package..." menu item or on the command
line with

```
raco pkg install rhombus
```

See also the [documentation Quick Start](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rhombus@rhombus/Quick_Start.html).

# Participation

**Anyone can participate in Rhombus design discussions.** The Racket team's
unofficial motto is _anything we can do, you can do:_ programmers should feel
empowered to participate in the creation of the languages they use. Discussions,
pull requests, and issues are open to all, and a wide variety of perspectives is
especially beneficial.

## Issues and Pull Requests

GitHub [**issues**](../../issues) are for bug reports and feature
ideas, and [**pull requests**](../../pulls) are for bug-fix candidates
and other concrete proposals.

## Conversations as Discussion

GitHub [**discussions**](../../discussions) provide a forum for discussing
Rhombus broadly, as opposed to discusssing details of specific
proposals.
